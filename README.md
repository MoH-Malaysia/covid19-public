### Static data

1) [`population.csv`](/static/population.csv) (last updated from DOSM 2020 release, to be updated with 2022 release shortly): 
 - `idxs`: integer coding for states (employed in cases linelist, cluster file, and school vax file)
 - `pop`: total population (all other columns are subset of `pop`)
 - `pop_18`: population aged 18+
 - `pop_60`: population aged 60+, also a subset of `pop_18`
 - `pop_12`: population aged 12-17
 - `pop_5`: population aged 5-11

_Static data will remain unchanged unless there is an update from the source, e.g. if DOSM makes an update to population estimates. We provide this data here not to supersede the source, but rather to be transparent about the data we use to compute key statistics e.g. the % of the population that is vaccinated. We also hope this ensures synchronisation (across various independent analysts) of key statistics._
