# Documentation for AEFI datasets
An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunisation. AEFIs are not necessarily caused by the vaccine - they can be related to the vaccine itself, to the vaccination process (stress related reactions) or can occur independently from vaccination (coincidental). 

The datasets include cases reported through both the NPRA Reporting System and MySejahtera.


_Disclaimers:_ 
- _The data are unverified (i.e. self-declared) reports of adverse events, both minor and serious, that occur after immunisation._
- _The number of reports alone cannot used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of AEFIs associated with vaccines._
- _Reported events are not always proven to have a causal relationship with the vaccine. Establishing causality requires additional investigation. Serious AEFI reports are always followed-up and investigated thoroughly for better understanding of the circumstances. However, our public data does not generally change based on information obtained from the investigation process (i.e. we do not reduce AEFI counts after the fact)._
- _The NPRA and MOH always consider the complexities mentioned above, in addition to various other factors, when analysing and monitoring vaccine safety._
